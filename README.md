# Simple_Compiler

A powerful compiler for while language

This is my Langauge Engineering unit's coursework, I wrote it during the first term of my second year's undergraduate study. It helped me understood compiler technique better and also helped me to improve my Java programming skills. I really enjoyed this coursework.
